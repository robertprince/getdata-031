# Question 1
#Register an application with the Github API here https://github.com/settings/applications. Access the API to get information on your instructors repositories (hint: this is the url you want "https://api.github.com/users/jtleek/repos"). Use this data to find the time that the datasharing repo was created. What time was it created? This tutorial may be useful (https://github.com/hadley/httr/blob/master/demo/oauth2-github.r). You may also need to run the code in the base R package and not R studio. 

library(httr)

# 1. Find OAuth settings for github:
#    http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/
oauth_endpoints("github")

# 2. To make your own application, register at at
#    https://github.com/settings/applications. Use any URL for the homepage URL
#    (http://github.com is fine) and  http://localhost:1410 as the callback url
#
#    Replace your key and secret below.
myapp <- oauth_app("github",
  key = "56b637a5baffac62cad9",
  secret = "8e107541ae1791259e9987d544ca568633da2ebf")

# 3. Get OAuth credentials
github_token <- oauth2.0_token(oauth_endpoints("github"), myapp)

# 4. Use API
gtoken <- config(token = github_token)
# req <- GET("https://api.github.com/users/jtleek/repos", gtoken)
# stop_for_status(req)
# content(req)
library(jsonlite)
jsonData <- fromJSON('https://api.github.com/users/jtleek/repos')
jsonData[jsonData$name == 'datasharing',]$created_at
